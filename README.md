__r__(isk)-__a__(ware ) __o__(ption) __p__(ricing) Library

_raop_ is a Python package providing several tools to analyse various types of 
financial options while considering risk factors.

## Key Features

* __Option Pricing__ and __Greeks Computation__ through multiple possible approaches
(Black-Scholes model, Binomial tree, Monte-Carlo simulations). Available types of options are:
  * European;
  * American.


* __Graph Generation__ to facilitate characterizing an option with sensitivity analyses
on its parameters.


* __Stochastic Processes Simulation__ with different possible processes. Available processes are currently:
  * Geometric Brownian Motion;
  * Arithmetic Brownian Motion;
  * Merton Jump-Diffusion;
  * Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process;
  * Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process;
  * Heston model;
  * Variance-Gamma model.


* Incoming features: 
  * __VaR Computation__
  * __Implied Volatility Computation__
